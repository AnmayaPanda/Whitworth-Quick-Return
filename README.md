# Whitworth Quick Return Mechanism Simulation

This MATLAB program simulates the Whitworth Quick Return Mechanism, a mechanical system used in engineering. The simulation includes the movement of various components as the mechanism undergoes a specified number of revolutions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/whitworth.git
    cd whitworth
    ```

2. **Run the MATLAB script:**

    Open MATLAB and execute the script `whitworth.m`.

    ```matlab
    whitworth
    ```

    This will prompt you to enter the number of revolutions for the simulation.

## Simulation Details

- The mechanism is simulated for the specified number of revolutions.
- Default values for lengths and other parameters are provided.
- The simulation is visualized in a MATLAB figure, showing the movement of different components.

## Visualization

The simulation generates a series of frames, visualizing the movement of the Whitworth Quick Return Mechanism over time. These frames are then compiled into a video.

## Output

The program outputs an uncompressed AVI video file named `Whitworth Quick Return Mechanism.avi`. You can find this file in the same directory as the MATLAB script.
